[NEUTRAL]Hello, [EMPEROR]. 
[NEUTRAL]Greetings, [EMPEROR].
[NEUTRAL]Pleasant tidings, [EMPEROR].
[NEUTRAL]How are you today, [EMPEROR]?
[FRIENDLY]I hope all is well with you and yours, [EMPEROR].
[FRIENDLY]Hello!
[FRIENDLY]How are you this fine morning, Your Excellence?
[FRIENDLY]What's up, doc? Er... I mean, [EMPEROR]. Sorry. Old Terran Empire humor.
[FRIENDLY]Ola!
[UNFRIENDLY]And... here you go again, messaging me. Hopefully for something worth my time, eh?
[FRIENDLY]Nice weather today on New Terra, I hope?
[NEUTRAL]It's a fine time to be alive. Although, the way our Empire is going, perhaps that won't be for much longer... eh?
[NEUTRAL]Anything new since last we talked?
[FRIENDLY]Greetings and salutations, [EMPEROR]!
[FRIENDLY]It is a wonderful day to be part of the Celestial Empire, Your Excellence!
[NEUTRAL]Hello.
[FRIENDLY]It is logical that I should wish you a pleasant morning.
[UNFRIENDLY]Well, well, if it isn't the new young bastard in charge.
[UNFRIENDLY]What do you want?
[UNFRIENDLY]Yes?
[UNFRIENDLY]You called, 'Emperor'?
[UNFRIENDLY]And just why do you feel the need to interrupt my morning?
[HOSTILE]Can I help you, Your Excellence, or did you just fat-finger the comm button again?
[HOSTILE]You dare to holo me? What guts you demonstrate.
[HOSTILE]For a child, you have bravery to look for me here.
[HOSTILE]It is only because I must answer that I do. You have me. What?
[HOSTILE]For what trivial matter must I put up with your homely visage darkening my holo now?
[HOSTILE]Incredible. After what you have done to me, you DARE summon me?
