Greetings, Emperor [EMPEROR].
Pleasant tidings, Emperor [EMPEROR].
How are you today, Emperor [EMPEROR]?
I hope all is well with you and yours, Emperor [EMPEROR].
Hello!
How are you this fine morning, Your Excellence?
What's up, doc? Er... I mean, Emperor [EMPEROR]. Sorry. Old Terran Empire humor.
Ola!
And... here you go again, messaging me. Hopefully for something worth my time, eh?
Nice weather today on New Terra, I hope?
It's a fine time to be alive. Although, the way our Empire is going, perhaps that won't be for much longer... eh?
Anything new since last we talked?
Greetings and salutations, Emperor [EMPEROR]!
It is a wonderful day to be part of the Celestial Empire, Your Excellence!
Hello.
It is logical that I should wish you a pleasant morning.
