The weather on [PLANET] is [ADJECTIVE] today, eh?
I can not believe the [PLANET] [SPORTSTEAM] [SPORTSRESULT] last night! You must feel [ADJECTIVE] about it!
I love [COLOR] flowers in the [ROOM], don't you?
I hope this communication finds you well.
Here on [PLANET], the people chant your name, Your Excellence.
I trust that you have not found me wanting, Your Excellence.
I really feel [ADJECTIVE] today.
Anything new with you in the big palace today?
We just painted our study [COLOR] last week. I think it is [ADJECTIVE], frankly.
Anything I need to know about?
Is there a problem on [PLANET], Your Excellence?
I am proud to report that House [HOUSE] stands vigilent over [PLANET], Your Excellence.
I do not feel well today.
I saw the most amazing meteor shower last week. It made me feel [ADJECTIVE].
Can you believe that the Empire has lasted almost a thousand years?
I can not wait to see what you can do, Your Excellence.
Sometimes, when no one is looking, I like to scratch the top of my head.
I grow weary of being on [PLANET] sometimes. Just saying.
What is new with you, Your Excellence?
How is life in the big chair treating you these days?
I truly believe [PLANET] is the nicest planet in the Celestial Empire.
